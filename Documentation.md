Limitations and Assumptions
This API assumes that the PersonContext is properly configured to interact with a database that includes a Person table or entity.
Error handling is implemented to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of failures.
The API does not implement authentication and authorization, assuming that it will be handled by external mechanisms.
Setting Up and Deploying the API
To set up and deploy the API, follow these general steps:

Ensure you have the necessary development tools and ASP.NET Core SDK installed.
Clone the project from a version control repository or create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
Configure the PersonContext to connect to your database.
Build and run the API locally for testing and development.
Deploy the API to a web server or cloud hosting platform for production use, following the deployment guidelines for ASP.NET Core applications.
Please refer to the official ASP.NET Core documentation and your hosting platform's documentation for detailed setup and deployment instructions.
