Known Limitations or Assumptions
The code assumes a PersonContext for database access but does not provide details about its implementation.
Error handling is minimal and doesn't provide detailed error messages or logging.
Input validation and data sanitization are not implemented. You should validate and sanitize user inputs in a real-world application.
The API does not implement authentication or authorization, so it's open for anyone to use.
It assumes that the Person class has properties such as Id and Name.

To set up and deploy the API, follow these general steps:

Ensure you have the necessary development tools and ASP.NET Core SDK installed.
Clone the project from a version control repository or create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
Configure the PersonContext to connect to your database.
Build and run the API locally for testing and development.
Deploy the API to a web server or cloud hosting platform for production use, following the deployment guidelines for ASP.NET Core applications.
Please refer to the official ASP.NET Core documentation and your hosting platform's documentation for detailed setup and deployment instructions.
